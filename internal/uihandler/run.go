/**
 * RunSource reads CI runs from GitHub for the UI's run pages.
 *
 * WHY A PAGE AND NOT ONLY A CARD: a run is the one thing here whose state CHANGES while a reader
 * watches it — steps turn green one by one — and a card is a snapshot from the moment the tool ran.
 * A page can be left open and refreshed.
 *
 * THE LOGS ARE NOT PART OF THIS. A run's logs are megabytes and a run has several jobs, so fetching
 * them with the run would make opening the page cost the whole log whether or not anybody read it.
 * They are a separate call per job, made when the reader asks.
