// One rule shapes this package: the ONLY way to change a repository is gh-pr-create, which
// turns the staging area into a branch and a pull request. There is no commit tool, no push
// tool, and no tool that writes to a branch. A caller cannot accidentally take a shortcut
// because there is no shortcut to take.
