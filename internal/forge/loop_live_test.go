/**
 * The whole loop, end to end, against a real forge and a real upstream.
 *
 * Each step is a SEPARATE call, because that is what the agent will do — this does not invent a
 * combined operation. The point is to prove the sequence works and that every step leaves the state
 * the next one expects: a stale main would produce a branch based on the wrong commit, and a patch
 * against a missing branch would fail in a way that looks like a forge problem.
 *
 * Needs a WRITABLE repository: a pull mirror cannot accept commits, which is why the sync uses git
 * rather than the mirror API.
