# A static Go binary. go-git is pure Go, so no system git is needed, and the runtime image is a
# bare alpine base.
#
# PORTABILITY: nothing environment-specific lives here. No internal mirror, no proxy, no
# *.svc.cluster.local. A CI runner and a laptop build the same image; anything a particular
# environment needs is supplied as a build-arg or by the container runtime.

# The browser UI, built FIRST and copied into the Go tree before `go build`.
#
# It is a build stage rather than committed output: a stale dist/ in the repository would be served
# in place of the real one, and the failure looks like "the UI is wrong" rather than "the build is
# wrong". Keeping the toolchain here also means a contributor needs nothing but Docker.

# Bump this to force `npm run build` to re-run.
#
# Docker caches a layer on its inputs; when a source file changes the COPY invalidates it, but when
# only the BUILD CACHE is stale (a restored gha cache from an earlier run) the old dist/ can be
# reused. It is rare and it is invisible: the image builds, the UI loads, and it behaves like the
# previous version.

# go:embed of an empty directory is legal, so a UI stage that produced nothing yields a binary with
# no assets and an extension that 404s every UI path — with a green CI. That is exactly what
# happened: the `ui` job passed (it builds the bundle separately) while the image shipped without it.
# Checking here makes the failure land where the mistake is.

# A cached `npm run build` ships a bundle that looks fine and behaves like the previous version,
# which is indistinguishable from "the fix did not work" when all you have is a browser. Greping a
# marker turns that into a build failure that names the marker.

# Workspaces are git checkouts on this pod's LOCAL disk. No database, no volume:
